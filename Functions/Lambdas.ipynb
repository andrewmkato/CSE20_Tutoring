This takes the form of shortcut strategies such as string slicing and tuple unpacking, as well as in name abbreviations like len() and \\_\\_init\\_\\_. Another feature along these lines is the ability to write anonymous, one-liner functions using the _lambda_ keyword. Anonymous functions appear in other languages as well, such as C++ and JavaScript, and are often called lambda functions or lambda expressions. This naming convention isn't random, so it's worth understanding why they're called what they are.",

Church opted to use the Greek symbol lambda, λ, for representing this system. Beyond mathematics, lambda notation also takes form in semantics, a branch of linguistics focused on meaning representations in natural language. A mathematical expression such as f(x) = x * 2, where x is a natural number, might look like the following in lambda calculus.\n\n   λ*x*: _x_ ∈ ℕ.*x* × 2\n\nThis function takes an input _x_, which must be an element in the set of all natural numbers ℕ, and returns _x_ × 2. λ itself does not carry meaning, except to denote the start of a particular function. The expression doesn't need a name. Consequently, the way that Python and various other programming languages implement or refer to anonymous functions is through lambda notation.",
