What  might be the most powerful and the most unique, though, is the [dictionary](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries). This particular data structure allows for automatic association between items and includes numerous methods for manipulation, all while keeping memory overhead low.\n\n## Context 📖\n\nWhen you think of the word *dictionary*, what do you normally think of? \n\nChances are, you picture a physical book, with each page containing definitions for all known words of a given language, such as English. A simplified representation of this is below.\n\n| Word | Definition |\n| ---- | ---------- |\n| *Aardvark* | A tan or dark brown African mammal with a long snout for finding food. |\n| *Ammonia* | A colorless, poisonous gas commonly used is cleaning products, fertilizer, and plastics. |\n| *Apple* | A spherical fruit with a red, green, or yellow exterior and a whitish, sweet interior. |\n| *Bear* | A large, furred mammal that is typically carnivorous, has brown fur, and hibernates in wintertime. |\n| *Boat* | A small vessel designed for traversing distances over water. |\n| *Cake* | An item made with baking ingredients such as eggs, flour, and sugar, and often takes a fluffy texture. |\n| ... | ... |\n\nThe information within this given book essentially contains two types of content: words and definitions. The above columns reflect this. The word *aardvark* comes with its own pre-defined meaning, as do *boat*, *cake*, and any other words the pages contain. We could represent this in Python as follows.",

This is only natural — since the goal here is to build a dictionary, and each word-definition pair shares a meaningful relationship. Yet, keeping these two types of values in separate structures ignores this desired association. Besides the chosen naming scheme, there's nothing indicating that the two lists share any sort of instrinsic connection. Sure, a class could be created that has each list as an attribute, or we might try to use the zip function for manipulation, but this is still tedious. \n\nIn computer memory, Python does not store these two lists in any special way that pairs up the lists' values either. They might as well be totally unrelated, and if either list's order changes unintentionally, bugs could be introduced. What we want is a seamless, intuitive, and concise way of maintaining **association** between items. This is where dictionaries come in.",
