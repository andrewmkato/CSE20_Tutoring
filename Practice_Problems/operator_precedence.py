# For the problems below, think about PEMDAS and how code should generally
#   incorporate parentheses for readability.

# TODO: Rewrite the equation below so it better reflects the order of operations.

# This code is valid in Python, and it will still run, but it is unnecessarily
#   unreadable. Edit it however you think would perhaps mitigate this.
equation1 = 2**5 -17- (20 + 1)*2/ 1


# TODO: What will the following equation display when printed? Feel free to edit.

equation2 = ((3)**(3-1)) + 2
# print(equation2)

# TODO: Even if you aren't quite sure what exactly the following equation does,
#       what do you think it means? Try breaking it down into smaller parts or
#       talking through it. Remember, it is a list, so it must contain at least
#       something.

equation3 = [number for number in range(0, 100) if number % 2 == 0]
# print(equation3)
