# Practice Problems for Students

This directory contains practice programming problems that have either already been used in my tutoring sessions or serve as additional examples for student use. They are generally open-ended prompts intended to encourage thoughtful, active learning of class concepts, from introductory control flow to creating complex class hierarchies. If you're a student practicing these, or simply want to see some helpful information, explore these prompts and check out the answers directory for example responses.
