# Think of slicing like grabbing a piece of a larger cake, except that piece
# is a copy rather than the real thing. In Python, strings are immutable, but
# you can pull out copies of string slices to manipulate them as needed.

# TODO: Use slice notation to assign to a new variable the first half of
#       the following string.

original_string = "loremipsumdolorsitamet"


# TODO: Now, reassign to that variable every third letter of original_string.


# TODO: Create a new variable, odd_nums, and assign to it a string containing
#       only the numbers in num_string that are odd. Plan how you might do this.
#       How would you be able to test each character in the string as a number?

num_string = "28393745129381"

# odd_nums should equal "39375931"
