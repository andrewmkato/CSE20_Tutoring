# Polymorphism is when something transforms its behavior depending on a given
#   situation. A real-world example is that a single person could simultaneously
#   be a mother, a wife, a grandmother, and a daughter.

# TASK: Demonstrate at least two examples in Python in which polymorphism
#   natively occurs. This could involve creating your own class, creating an
#   expressions with certain operators, or something else.

# Here's an example for assistance.
text1 = "Hello"
text2 = "world!"
phrase = text1 + text2 # Concatenation.

num1 = 12
num2 = 3
sum = num1 + num2 # Addition.

pass



# TODO: EXAMPLE TWO HERE
