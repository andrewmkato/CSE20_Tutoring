# One of the simpler yet fundamental usages of a computer programming languages
#   is for arithmetic equations. Python is like a personal calculator in that
#   you can do basic calculations, and build more complex ones. Calculus,
#   statistics, and other advanced mathematics can be done all in Python. These
#   problems are meant to engage a basic understanding of how calculations are
#   done in the language, as well as how operator precedence works.

# TODO: What would the value of the variable below be if you were to print it
#       out? Give it a try? Change the symbols and see what happens!

x = 9 + (13 - 20) + 2
# print(x)


# TODO: Fix the commented-out equations below so that Python won't throw an 
#       error if run. Are the symbols correct? The goal is to have answer1 equal
#       81. Next, answer2 should equal 1.

# answer1 = 9 x 9
# answer2 = 2^4 - 15
