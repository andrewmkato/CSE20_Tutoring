What  might be the most powerful and the most unique, though, is the [dictionary](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries).

Think of it like this: when looking for a word's definition in a physical dictionary, do you search for the page number? Most of the time, that answer is no. Instead, you likely search for the word instead. Although real-world dictionaries are alphabetized, extending this structure to examples that don't include words and definitions means that there can't be alphabetization. As a result, Python dictionaries do not have ordering in memory."
