Before we dive into why those features are useful, let's first learn why lists exist in the first place.\n\n## Context and Understanding\n\nWhat do you picture in real life when thinking about what the word _list_ means? It's probably the case that one example you thought of is the kind that one might take to a grocery store for shopping. This could look like bullet points with items, similar to what is seen below.",

Below that, each desired type of item comes one after the other in some order, which could be happenstance or maybe deliberate based on something such as priority. In terms of purpose, this will keep track of what items to look for in the store, and as items are picked up, they might be crossed out as we go.\n\n| Items to Pick Up at the Grocery Store Today|\n| ---- |\n| Granny Smith Apples |\n| Leafy green salad with spinach|\n| ~~Bulk napkins~~ |\n| Water |\n| Pickle jars |\n| ~~Pink Bubblegum~~ |\n| ... | ... |\n\nSo, this list might eventually look like the above when the list's shopper finds the napkins and the bubblegum. Additionally, if the shopper perhaps forgot to include an item on the list, they could just add it in somewhere.\n\n| Items to Pick Up at the Grocery Store Today|\n| ---- |\n| Granny Smith Apples |\n| Leafy green salad with spinach|\n| ~~Bulk napkins~~ |\n| Water |\n| Pickle jars |\n| ~~Pink Bubblegum~~ |\n| Blood oranges |\n| ... | ... |\n\nLet's take a step back now.
