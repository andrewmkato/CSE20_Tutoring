# Data Structures in Python

In most any given programming language, data structures serve as a means to collect, manipulate, move, and store information. Oftentimes, this data can be on nearly any scale, at nearly any capacity. To perform calculations, build long-lasting websites, or do any other task through computer programming, you'll likely need to incorporate data structures throughout your code.

In Python, there are four main data structures, each of which are incredibly powerful and useful in their own rights. They serve different purposes, and some prove more helpful than others depending on the given situation. Each of them are listed below, with a brief definition for each.

- _List_: An ordered, mutable collection of literals, which are contiguous in computer memory. They can be of any type or data structure in any pattern, and can be operated on accordingly.
- _Tuple_: An ordered, immutable collection of literals, which are contiguous in computer memory. They can also be of any type or data structure, for the most part. Unlike lists, tuples cannot be directly altered.
- _Dictionary_: An unordered, mutable collection of key-value literal pairs, in which keys are generally called to access their respective value. Multiple keys can have identical values, but a singular key cannot possess multiple values nor be repeated.
- _Set_: An unordered, mutable collection of non-duplicate literals.

The general appearance and notation of creating each data structure above take the form of the following in Python code.

_List_:
```
list_name = [element, element, ... , element]
```

_Tuple_:
```
tuple_name = (element, element, ... , element)
```

_Dictionary_:
```
dictionary_name = {key: value, key: value, ... , key_value}
```

_Set_:
```
set_name = {element, element, ... , element} # Non-duplicate elements.
```
