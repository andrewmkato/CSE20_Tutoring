# Tutoring
Resources used for tutoring sessions for CSE 20: Programming with Python.

Key foundational concepts in computer science are covered using Python in the course.
- Data structures: Dictionaries, lists/vectors, tuples/arrays.
- Object-oriented programming: Class construction, hierarchy, getters/setters
- Input/Output (IO): File manipulation, reading in data.

This repository serves as a place to store useful guides for students in my sessions.
